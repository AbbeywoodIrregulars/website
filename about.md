# The Abbeywood Irregulars

The Irregulars started life some 15 years ago as a loose collection of Civil Servants playing in Bristol, over that period they have spread their group both geographically and in background and are now a mixed bag of wargamers who meet monthly for larger games (typically up to 16 players) and to put on games at wargames shows.

We play a range of periods from Ancients (15mm DBM), SAGA (28mm), through ECW (15mm), AWI (28mm) and Napoleonics (15mm) to ACW (28mm), 19th Century (15mm Zulus, 28mm Boxers), WW2 (15mm & 28mm) and Modern (20mm) conflicts.

There is also opportunity for Warhammer 40K supported by pupils from a local college.

Recently, the group have branched out into "Bolt Action" and "A Very British Civil War (1939 and all that!)" which goes to show we're learning new tricks - despite playing DBM.

## Contact Details

The Irregulars meet at the Bennett Centre, St. John's Church Hall, Vicarage Street, **Frome**, **Somerset**. Our larger games are held on the first Saturday of each month (09:30 till late) with smaller games being organised for Friday evenings or other Saturdays on ad hoc arrangements.

Currently the hall is undergoing renovation which limits easy access so please discuss any potential issues with us before arrival.
