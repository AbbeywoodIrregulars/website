title: '“Frome Peninsula” DBA / DBM Campaign'
date: "2016-02-07"

On Saturday 5th March 2016 the planned game is an Ancient Wargames Campaign.  The campaign will be fought over the “Frome Peninsula” [map](/static/Frome_Peninsula_v5_No_scale.jpeg).  This is a hex map and players will need to maneuver over it to achieve their campaign objectives.

Each player’s objective will be to obtain as many Victory points as possible in the course of the campaign, by capturing cities and towns, winning battles, and obtaining and retaining treasury funds in the form of Supply Points (SP).  The campaign rules are available as a [PDF](/static/Frome_Peninsula_v6.pdf).

Each player will start the campaign commanding an army of 100 army points (based on a simplified DBM 3.3 points list, adapted to cover the DBA element types).  In addition, they will control a ‘city’ (settlement with a wall on the map) and three local ‘towns’ (small settlement with no wall).  Each 100AP Army Command will conform to a DBM100 / DBMM 100 army list.

Instead of using the DBM3.3 rules to resolve battles, we have chosen instead for simplicity to use the DBA 3.0 rules, but to make the army commands larger (similar to DBM 100).  DBA purists may regard this as sacrilege, but we are experimenting and seeing if we can get a different feel to the standard DBA ‘nodal’ campaign and 12 element armies format.  For simplicity a DBA 3.0 [quick reference sheet](/static/dba3_qrs.pdf) is available.

Join us on the day to see how things work out!
