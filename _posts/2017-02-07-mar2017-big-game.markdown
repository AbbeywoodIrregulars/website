Stephen Etheridge has released the following information about March's big game:

>Gentlemen,
>
>The main game for 4 March will be another of my soggy naval encounters, this time set during the Anglo-Dutch contretemps during the 17th century.
>
>As Pete said on Saturday last, we will be limited a little for space as the main hall will be in alternative use, so it would be helpful for me to gauge numbers who want to (or will!) play.
>
>Each player will control a squadron of ships (3-5), or so the plan is currently.  The game will be using rules from Rod Langton, "Tiller and Whipstaff" which are reputed to be quick play.............but I will see about that when I playtest them!
>
> Can you reply ASAP so I can get planning.
>
> Thanks,
