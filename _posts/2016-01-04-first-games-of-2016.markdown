So last Saturday, January 2, saw The Abbeywood Irregulars gather for their first meeting of the new year. It was a very relaxed affair with no real plan except for some games to be played and mince pies consumed. There had also been talk of mulled wine.

Games played during the day included:

- Airfix Battles
- SAGA
- SAGA - The Crescent and The Cross
- DBM

Of these, Airfix Battles was the most played. This was a playtest version of the game that will be released later this year by [Modiphius Entertainment](http://www.modiphius.com/airfix.html). Thanks to Allen for bringing it along for us to try out. I know it garnered a number of positive comments and suspect it may well be making a regular appearance once it is released.

I don't think any photos were taken on the day, but if they were, I'll update this post with some links.

Next up it's 15mm Napoleonic (Northern Wars) on Saturday, February 6. More details to (hopefully) follow.
