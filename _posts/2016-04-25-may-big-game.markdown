So our next big game in on Saturday May 7 and sees us once again returning to Normandy 1944 with [Mission Command](http://www.surprisedstaregames.co.uk/MissionCommand/).

The scenario this time will be a psuedo-historical affair, so that reading up on the history wonâ€™t be relevant.  Set around Caen it will pit the Canadians against the Germans.

Alan has put some more details on his [blog](https://benthamfish2.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/the-day-after-d-day/), so I'm not going to repeat them here.

I have offered to help umpire, as well as take lots of photos. I'm looking forward to being able to see the whole game unfold. Hopefully there will be lots to report afterwards.

There are currently eight players signed up, but there is definitely room for more, so if you want to take part, please do [let us know](mailto:contact@abbeywoodirregulars.uk).

Look forward to seeing everyone on the 7th.

Neil.
