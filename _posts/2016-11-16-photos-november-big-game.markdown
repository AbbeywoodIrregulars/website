A small selection from November's big game of Mission Command can be found on [Flickr](https://flic.kr/s/aHskNVR5D4).

Thanks to Alan for making the trip down to put the game on and for everyone who participated. It was a close run thing with neither side having really gained the upper hand by the time we decided to draw things to a close. A day well spent.

Neil.
