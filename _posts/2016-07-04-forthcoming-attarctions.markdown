Details of a few upcoming dates for your diaries:

## Attack! 2016
Attack! 2016 is at Devizes School on July 16 & 17. Whilst AWI aren't running a game at the show this year, a few members will be in attendance. Neil will be helping the Wings of Glory Aerodrome UK Wing run World War One dogfights all weekend, whilst Pete, Steve and John will be taking part in the DBM competition. Full details including lists of traders and participation games can be found at the show's website - [http://www.ddwg.org.uk/attack-2016/](http://www.ddwg.org.uk/attack-2016/).

## August Big Game
Having missed July due to the Frome Festival, we are back to normal in August with a slightly unusual big game - “Not Quite Islandwana”. Full details to come in a follow up post, but if your fancy facing off against thousands of zulus, put Saturday August 6 in your diary.

## IPMS Avon Annual Show
The [IPMS Avon](http://ipmsavon.org.uk) Annual Show is at Thornbury Leisure Centre on Sunday August 7. Richard and J will be putting on an ACW demonstration game.

Richard says:

> The game is Antietam (from the Sunken Lane to Dunker Church, to be precise. I have made models of both of these landmarks). I expect to have 5 Confederate and 7 Federal brigades (not necessarily those that were present at the real Antietam) plus 6 artillery batteries and vignettes (and an observation balloon - definitely not there, but might have been. This gets a mention in the display sheets).

Whilst this is predominately a modeling show, there will be a number of wargames traders there, as well as some other demonstration and participation games. Full details can be found at [http://ipmsavon.org.uk/shows.php](http://ipmsavon.org.uk/shows.php).
