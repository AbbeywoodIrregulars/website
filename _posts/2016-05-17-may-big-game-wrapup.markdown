The May Big Game of Mission command has been and gone. Alan is writing some after action reports and rather then reproduce them here, I'm going to link to them so he gets some traffic to his site.

 - [Part 1](https://benthamfish2.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/the-day-after-d-day-1/)
 - Part 2 to follow

Photos from the day can be found on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/gp/abbeywoodirregulars/137978).

Thanks to everyone who turned up and made it a great day. Until the next time.

Neil.
