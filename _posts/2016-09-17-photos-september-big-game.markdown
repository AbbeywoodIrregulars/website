A small selection from September's big game of the 1970s Cod Wars can be found on [Flickr](https://flic.kr/s/aHskHY1BXr).

Thanks to Stephen Etheridge for organising what was a fun days gaming that saw the Icelandic Coast Guard come away with the victory, or should that be, the least damaged public rating. Apparently the Royal Navy are still holding the enquiry in to how one of their warships not only rammed and heavily damaged another of their fleet, causing it to have to return to port, but also managed to ram and sink one of the British trawler fleet! Not a great day for the British all told.
