Today I've created both Flickr and Twitter accounts for The Abbeywood Irregulars. Flickr is so that photos can be easily shared and linked to from the website and Twitter as another way to get news about the groups activities out to a wider audience.

Links to both services have been added to the navigation bar above, but for completeness, here are the appropriate web addresses:

  Flickr - [https://www.flickr.com/photos/abbeywoodirregulars/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/abbeywoodirregulars/)  
  Twitter - [https://twitter.com/AbbeywoodIrregs](https://twitter.com/AbbeywoodIrregs)  

There is also a Flickr Group at [https://www.flickr.com/groups/abbeywoodirregulars/](https://www.flickr.com/groups/abbeywoodirregulars/), for anyone who already has a Flickr account to add photos to, rather than have them re-uploaded to the group's account.
